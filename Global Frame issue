I could just remove the texture:

			local torderhall=orderhall:CreateTexture(nil,"ARTWORK")
				torderhall:SetAllPoints(orderhall)
				torderhall:SetColorTexture(0, 192, 255, 0.7)
				

and call it a day, it will work but the event frame I created, orderhall, will always be on screen, albeit invisible, but I want to hide the frame or at least trigger "orderhall:EnableMouse(false)" when outside of the Order Hall so that it doesn't cause potential mouseover issues with other frames, namely the buff button frames.


I can't figure out how to check if the global frame OrderHallCommandBar is shown or visible.

I tried setting "OrderHallCommandBar" as my frame "orderhall" 's parent, hoping when "OrderHallCommandBar" would hide so would "orderhall", to no avail.

"OrderHallCommandBar" appears to be protected but I can't find any functions to hook to.

There is a default Blizzard made addon called "Blizzard_OrderHallUI" so I can check to see if it is loaded. Problem is that it doesn't unload, so if I physically walk outside of an order Hall there is not a way to check if "Blizzard_OrderHallUI" is loaded because ti is now loaded. So while that might work, once I go back into the Order Hall then the check is now stopped.

I will append "Blizzard_OrderHallUI" 's scripts: Blizzard_OrderHallCommandBar.lua and Blizzard_OrderHallCommandBar.xml

Anyway. Thanks for any help you can provide. I am not really educated on this, just tinkering, heh, so I don;t know common logic tricks or problem solving or, I guess "bootstrapping" procedures?

Cheers!
